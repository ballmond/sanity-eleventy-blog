# Student

Grace Student Ministry is an incredible group that loves to have fun, make new friends, encourage others, serve in the community, engage God’s Word, talk about Jesus and live great lives together!

We meet every Sunday morning at 9:30am for Youth Sunday School.

We meet every Wednesday Night at 7pm for Youth Group.

**Hey Grace Parents! We are so excited about what God is doing in and through our Student Ministry!**

We are right in the middle of a Youth Sunday School apologetic series called “Ask” – answering the top questions that Gen Zers are asking. Every Sunday 9:45-10am on Zoom.

Our Wednesday Night Youth Group is meeting in person at the church and following all the Covid-19 guidelines. We are opening the scriptures every week and talking about the “But God” stories where God intervenes during our toughest times.
