# Young Adults

Welcome to Young Adults at Grace Baptist Church!

We serve college-age students. It doesnâ€™t matter if they are in college or thinking about college. What matters most is allowing God to show them the way!

Young Adult Sunday School is every Sunday at 9:30 am September through June.

If you have any questions please contact Brady Rennix (GracelandStudents437@gmail.com).
