# Music

## Children’s Choir

Our Graceland children are given the opportunity to participate in a variety of musical experiences. Throughout the Sunday School year they sing songs of joy, ring choir chimes and have fun occasionally participating in a mini musical. Each month our goal is to feature the children in the Sunday Worship Service.

## Sanctuary Choir

The Sanctuary choir is open to all those who love to sing. The choir of 25-30 enthusiastic singers participates each Sunday in worship. Musical selections include traditional, contemporary and classical styles. Rehearsals are held each Sunday after worship with occasional workshops to prepare for special Christmas and Easter services. Additionally the choir presents a special Fall Concert designed to reach out to the community, family and friends. Shows from Broadway to Disney have drawn over-flow audiences. During the Christmas Season, you can experience the choir singing carols in the Montgomery Mall as part of their holiday celebration.

## Handbell Choir

Dressed in their white gloves, this intergenerational choir of ringers meets every Wednesday evening at 7:15PM. They share in worship once a month.

## Praise Team

Each Sunday, this small group of singers and instrumentalists leads the congregation in several Praise Songs as part of our “blended” worship experience. Accompanied by guitars, and other instruments (drums, mandolin, etc.) our Praise team brings a contemporary flair to round out our worship experience
