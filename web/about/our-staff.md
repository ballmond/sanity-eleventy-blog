His vision for the church and his personal ministry are rooted in Jesus’ words, “Love the Lord Your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself.” His passion in ministry is to help people connect with and experience God’s transforming presence and equip them to become agents of transformation in our world that is dying for hope, change, and the transformation that only God can bring. Romans 12:1-2; Micah 6:8; and Ephesians 4:11-12 are verses that guide Pastor David’s life and ministry.

Previously, he has served as the pastor of the Baptist Church of West Chester, Lansdowne Baptist Church, and led U.S. and Canadian students on peace building/cross cultural exchanges to South Africa.
