# What We Believe

We believe that God, who created the universe in the beginning, is still actively creating.

We believe that faith in Jesus Christ puts us in a new and vital relationship with God.

We believe that the Holy Spirit is present and active among those who believe, encouraging us to love one another and to do good works in the world.

We believe that the best way to find out what God is like is to study the teachings of Jesus and to understand the attitudes and convictions which guided his life.

We believe that God loves and cares about people of every race, language, and nation on the face of the earth.

We believe that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”, but that God loves every child and every man and woman on earth, and seeks to bring every person into spiritual maturity and into perfect love.

We believe that worship is for the praise of God and for celebrating God’s love together, and that worship demands, whatever excellence in music, preaching, prayer, and the use of all our gifts, which we can bring to it.

## We believe our mission is to serve others and to reach out to share with them the joy of the Gospel and all that Christ means to us.

We believe in YOU, your gifts, and your potential.

## Facts you should know about Grace Baptist Church

- Grace Baptist Church, founded in 1872, is an American Baptist Church, and currently, we are members of the Philadelphia Baptist Association (PBA), which is the oldest continuous association of Baptist churches in the United States.

- Our congregation was originally located in Philadelphia. Its original name was also Grace Baptist Church. When the church started to grow, and they erected a new church building at Broad and Berks Streets, it took on the nickname “The Temple.”

- Hattie May Wiatt was a small girl who saved up 57 cents for the building of the new church facility. She sadly passed away in 1886 before the land was purchased, but Dr. Conwell used her donation to help raise the other necessary funds. The full story is on our website- gracebaptistbluebell.org. It has been retold for many years in many congregations across the country.

- Dr. Russell Conwell, who was pastor of the church at the time, oversaw the building of the new, much larger church building, and also facilitated the founding of The Temple University (which started with 7 individuals who sought a higher education, but did not have the money to pay for it), as well as the founding of Temple Hospital (the small Samaritan, Garretson, and Greatheart hospitals were merged to form one larger hospital).

- The congregation moved out to Blue Bell in 1975.
